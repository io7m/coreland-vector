20061227 version: vector 0.1
20060310 version: vector 0.11
20070517 code: vec_align.h header created. vec_unaligned() is now always
               a macro which calls vec_unaligned_core(). this allows better
               warnings to be emitted. ptr_uint type is used instead of
               unsigned long.
