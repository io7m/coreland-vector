20060310 version: vector 0.11
20070517 code: vec_align.h header created. vec_unaligned() is now always
               a macro which calls vec_unaligned_core(). this allows better
               warnings to be emitted. ptr_uint type is used instead of
               unsigned long.
20070517 version: vector 0.111
20070608 code: vector-conf.c from common source.
20071008 version: vector 0.112
20071008 code: rewrote speed tests, renamed source files to v_* instead of vec_*
               and added sd-inline for inlining calls.
